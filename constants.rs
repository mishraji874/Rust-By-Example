// Constants are immutable values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change throughout the execution of the program. Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.

// constants are declared using `const` keyword
// for naming we can use all capital letters and underscope for spaces
